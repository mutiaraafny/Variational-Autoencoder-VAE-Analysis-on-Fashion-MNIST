# Variational-Autoencoder-VAE-Analysis-on-Fashion-MNIST
The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model that we developed is a highly effective generative model. Unlike traditional autoencoders, which only learn data compression, the VAE uses a probabilistic approach to ensure its latent representations are well distributed. This makes it ideal for generating new data.
